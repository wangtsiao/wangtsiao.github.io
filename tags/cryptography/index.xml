      <description>Polynomials are an fundamental mathematical tool within the field of cryptography, where they play a vital role in the design of zero knowledge proofs and the implementation of secure communication systems. In cryptography, the utilization of polynomials diverges from their traditional usage, as they are defined over a finite field rather than the real numbers. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all operations discussed in this blog pertain to integers within a finite field.</description>

      <title>Folding Scheme: A Remarkable Breakthrough in ZKP</title>

      <description>A folding scheme is defined with respect to an NP relation, and it is a protocol between an untrusted prover and a verifier. Both entities hold two N-sized NP instances, and the prover in addition holds purported witnesses for both instances. The protocol enables the prover and the verifier to output a single N-sized NP instance, which we refer to as a folded instance. A folding scheme guarantees that the folded instance is satisfiable only if the original instances are satisfiable.</description>

      <description>1. Preliminaries 1.1 Bilinear Groups The proof system works with bilinear groups $(p, \mathbb{G}_1, \mathbb{G}_2, \mathbb{G}_T, e)$ with the following properties:
$\mathbb{G}_1, \mathbb{G}_2, \mathbb{G}_T$ are groups of prime order p $e: \mathbb{G}_1 \times \mathbb{G}_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{G}_T$ is a bilinear map i.e., $e(U^a, V^b)=e(U, V)^{ab}$ If $G$ is a generator for $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $H$ is a generator for $\mathbb{G}_2$ then $e(G, H)$ is a generator for $\mathbb{G}_T$. There are efficient algorithms for computing group operations, evaluating the bilinear map, deciding membership of the groups, deciding equality of group elements and sampling generators of the groups.</description>

      <title>A Note on IPA/DARKS/KZG Polynomial Commitment</title>

      <description>Polynomial commitment is a cryptographic tool that has numerous applications in areas such as blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, and secure multiparty computation. It allows one party to commit and later prove to another party that the committed data satisfies certain properties.
In this post, I will present several polynomial commitment schemes that have proven to be highly valuable, including IPA, DARKS, and KZG. Furthermore, I will provide a comparison of these schemes.</description>
